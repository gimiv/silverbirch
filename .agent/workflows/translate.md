description: Parse raw stakeholder feedback into actionable technical and product requirements
---

1.  **Analyze the Feedback**:
    *   Read the provided text carefully.
    *   Identify the persona/source (e.g., "Marketing", "Business Partner", "End User").
    *   Extract key themes: UI/UX, Feature Requests, Business Logic, Long-term Strategy.

2.  **Contextualize**:
    *   Compare the feedback against the current state of the project.
    *   Identify what already exists, what needs modification, and what is net-new.

3.  **Translate to Tech Specs**:
    *   Convert vague requests (e.g., "make it pop") into specific design implementation details (e.g., "increase contrast, add hover animations").
    *   Map business goals (e.g., "capture emails") to technical features (e.g., "implement exit-intent modal with TryDrawbridge integration").

4.  **Output Format**:
    *   **The "Translation"**: A concise summary of what they *actually* want.
    *   **Direct Action Items**: A checklist of immediate todos.
    *   **Parking Lot / Phase 2**: Ideas that are strategic or for later.
    *   **Clarifying Questions**: Specific questions to resolve ambiguity.
